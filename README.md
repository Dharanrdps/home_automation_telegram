Controlling of appliances using Telegram Bot and NodeMCU Wi-Fi module.

There are 3 steps involved to complete the automation/n
Step 1 - Creating a Bot
For this you need to visit bot named "BotFather" on telegram and create your-self a newbot with the command "/newbot". After naming the bot, you will receive a bot-token which you need to replace in the ino code provided. Later on change the SSID, Password in the ino file according to your network.

Step 2 - Uploading ino file into NodeMCU
Install required drivers for NodeMCU and then upload the code onto nodemcu

Step 3 - Connections
This code is written for two LED's and two sensors(Digital & Analog). Connect the LED's and Sensors according the respective pins(given in the code).

Now you are set to start the bot and experience it. Start off by entering the command "/start"
